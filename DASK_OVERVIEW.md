## Core Features

### Simplified Financial Management
- **Session Tracking:**
  - A simple "Start Session" button monitors work hours, breaks, and session duration in the background, with a persistent notification for transparency.
- **Smart Expense Logging:**
  - Capture photos of physical receipts (e.g., fuel), and our cutting-edge Gemini Nano AI automatically extracts crucial data (amounts, dates, vendors). This minimizes manual entry and ensures tax-ready accuracy.
- **Detailed Reports:**
  - Generate clear summaries of earnings, expenses, and data ready for accounting.

### "Cherry Picker" - Intelligent Trip Optimization (Game-Changing Feature)
- **Real-time Trip Analysis:**
  - Our technology reads live trip offers from apps like Uber, 99, and others, extracting critical details (pickup, destination, fare, distance).
- **Profitability Calculation:**
  - Instantly calculates estimated profitability (e.g., $/mile, $/hour) based on the driver's preferences.

### Audio-First Communication (Accessibility & Safety)
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
  - For drivers with dyslexia, visual impairments, or those prioritizing safety, the app narrates trip details aloud (e.g., "New trip offer! Pick up at Main Street, drop off at Oak Avenue. Estimated fare: R$ 35.50."). Drivers don't need to read the screen.
- **Voice Commands (Hands-Free Accept/Decline):**
  - After the offer is spoken, drivers can simply say "Accept" or "Decline." Our Speech-to-Text (STT) engine recognizes their command, allowing interaction with the offer without taking hands off the wheel or eyes off the road.

### User Control and Responsible AI
- **Explicit, Per-Session Consent:**
  - The "Cherry Picker" feature is activated only after the user grants manual, explicit, per-session consent by enabling our app's Accessibility Service in Android settings.
- **Full Transparency:**
  - We clearly disclose what data is read and why (e.g., "to calculate profitability and provide audio guidance").
- **Automatic Timeout & Guided Disablement:**
  - Sessions have a 4-hour timeout. If forgotten, the app pauses screen reading and guides the user to manually disable the Accessibility Service, prioritizing privacy and battery.
- **On-Device AI Privacy:**
  - Our use of Gemini Nano for receipt processing ensures sensitive financial data remains on the user's device, maximizing privacy.

## The Problem: The Modern Driver's Dilemma in Brazil

The gig economy in Brazil, especially ride-sharing, offers flexibility but often leaves drivers overwhelmed and underserved.

- **Financial Chaos:** Managing multiple income streams, fluctuating expenses (fuel, maintenance, tolls), and complex tax deductions is a nightmare. Drivers lose significant income due to poor record-keeping, missed deductions, and inefficient tracking.
- **"Decision Fatigue" on the Road:** During peak hours, drivers are bombarded with trip offers. Quickly assessing profitability (distance vs. fare, potential dead miles) while driving safely is a constant challenge, leading to missed opportunities or unprofitable trips.
- **Accessibility Gap:** For the millions of drivers with dyslexia, ADHD, visual processing disorders, or those who simply prioritize hands-on-wheel safety, quickly reading and reacting to on-screen trip offers from multiple apps is a significant barrier and a safety hazard. Current solutions are visual-only.

## The Market in Brazil

- Brazil's gig economy is a rapidly growing sector, with **1.5 million** people engaged in passenger or delivery services, and over **5 million** Brazilian workers earning their primary income from digital platforms.
- **Uber** has over **600,000 drivers** in Brazil, with a 65% market share. **99 (DiDi)** has approximately **750,000 active drivers**, with 35% of the market. Together, they serve **28 million active users**.
- Brazil's ride-hailing services market is projected to reach **US$ 3,044.3 million by 2030**, growing at a CAGR of **14.9% from 2022 to 2030**.
- Digital accessibility in Brazil remains a significant challenge: less than **1%** of websites and apps offer accessibility services for people with disabilities, despite over **17 million Brazilians** (almost 8% of the population) having some form of disability. This highlights a huge unmet need.

This scenario represents a massive, underserved market segment, ripe for a smart, tailored solution.

## How it Works (User Journey)

1. **Download & Setup:** Simple installation and a quick guided tour.
2. **Start Your Day:** The driver taps the large "Start Session" button.
3. **Enable Trip Optimizer (First Time / Per Session):**
   - A clear, in-app dialogue prominently explains the "Trip Optimizer" and its benefits (hands-free operation, profitability analysis).
   - The user is guided step-by-step to Android settings to manually enable [App Name]'s Accessibility Service. This is done per session.
   - Once enabled, the system confirms, and the "Cherry Picker" activates.
4. **Drive & Earn:**
   - The app runs in the background, tracking time and (if enabled) intelligently observing ride-hailing app offers.
   - **New Offer Detected:** [App Name] audibly announces the offer: "New Trip: Pick up [X], Drop off [Y], Fare [Z]."
   - **Voice Command:** The driver says "Accept" or "Decline."
   - **Auto-Logging:** Accepted/declined trips are automatically logged in their accounting dashboard.
5. **Log Expenses:** The driver taps "Add Expense," snaps a photo of a receipt, our Gemini Nano AI extracts the data, and the expense is logged with minimal typing.
6. **End Session:** The driver taps "End Session." The app calculates earnings, ends the timer, and guides the user to manually disable the Accessibility Service (for privacy/battery).
7. **Review & Report:** Daily/weekly/monthly summaries are available, ready for tax season.

## Why Now? The Unmet Need & Our Advantage

- **Booming Gig Economy:** The market is expanding rapidly in Brazil, but tools for gig workers remain fragmented or generic.
- **Universal Driver Pain Points:** Financial complexity and on-road decision-making are constant struggles.
- **Accessibility as a Differentiator:** While many apps offer basic accounting, none provide this level of integrated, voice-controlled trip optimization with explicit accessibility considerations for the driving context. This opens up a significant, underserved segment of the driver population.
- **Technological Readiness & AI Innovation:** Modern Android APIs (Accessibility Service, Foreground Service, TTS, STT), combined with React Native's New Architecture and Google's powerful Gemini Nano AI, make this advanced solution technically feasible and high-performing right now, offering on-device intelligence and privacy.
- **Leadership in Responsible AI:** Our transparent, user-controlled approach to sensitive data access differentiates us from any potential "shady" alternatives, fostering trust and ensuring Google Play compliance.

## Competitive Landscape

- **Existing Accounting Apps** (e.g., Stride, Everlance, or Brazil-focused like Drivh):
  - Good for accounting, but lack real-time, voice-controlled trip optimization from other apps. Some use accessibility for reading but don't integrate robust, accessible TTS/STT.
- **"GiggU" (Niche Competitors):**
  - Primarily focus on screen scraping, often lack accounting features, and may struggle with Play Store compliance due to less transparent permission models. They generally don't have the robust accessibility features we offer.
- **Ride-Hailing Apps (Uber/99):**
  - Their own apps don't offer integrated cross-platform accounting or advanced hands-free optimization for third-party offers.

**Our Competitive Edge:**
We combine best-in-class accounting with a unique, accessible, Gemini Nano-powered and compliant "Cherry Picker" and voice-controlled system, creating a holistic solution unmatched in the market.

  - Unlimited session tracking & detailed reports.
  - Full "Cherry Picker" functionality (real-time trip analysis, TTS, STT).
  - Advanced receipt processing via Gemini Nano AI.
  - Priority support.
  - Potentially, integrations with popular accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks).
